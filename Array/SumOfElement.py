# Sum of element

# Initialize an array (list) of integers
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a variable to store the total sum, starting at 0
total = 0

# Loop through each element 'j' in the array 'arr'
for j in arr:
    # Add the current element 'j' to the total
    total = total + j

# After the loop ends, print the total sum of all elements
